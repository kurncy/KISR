We will provide standard text, media, and images for use in compliant implementations.

- Standard text: localization-ready copy blocks for screens, dialogs, and notifications.

- Images: logo sets, icons, and illustrative assets with usage guidelines.

Please do not substitute or modify these assets without approval to maintain conformance with KISR guidelines.
